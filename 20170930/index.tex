their mentation, through perhaps the rhythm of his - the listener's
- deliberate and default words, his like countenance, his bodily
movements and stases, etc., all of which I congenitally do, except that
it additionally occurs to me that the listener could also be engaged in
surveying \textit{my} mentation. Then, it is a matter of psychic tennis

A:...

B: Yes. I love you.
