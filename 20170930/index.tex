B: I wouldn't say they so much \textit{slip} out of my mouth as they

B: Speaking to the speech-capable is psychically tense for me. Being
a congenital liar myself, I'm unable to tell if I'm ever being taken
seriously. Which is weird because in order to be a good liar, one ought

their mentation, through perhaps the rhythm of his - the listener's
- deliberate and default words, his like countenance, his bodily
movements and stases, etc., all of which I congenitally do, except that
it additionally occurs to me that the listener could also be engaged in
surveying \textit{my} mentation. Then, it is a matter of psychic tennis

prefer, one of us has to truncate this like infinite series expansion. 

A:...

B: That's right. The more I drink, the sooner I commit the fault, or the
fewer terms in the series if you will. Its a relief really. The kind

A:...

B: Call it narcissism or solipsism or even alcoholism. I don't give

A:...

B: Yes. I love you.
