B: Social lubricant. Plain and simple.

B: I wouldn’t say they so much <i>slip</i> out of my mouth as they <i>glide</i> out of it, at least before the fourth drink. After that, yeah, I’ll admit to some significant slippage.

B: Speaking to the speech-capable is psychically tense for me. Being a congenital liar myself, I’m unable to tell if I’m ever being taken seriously. Which is weird because in order to be a good liar, one ought to like <i>gauge</i> the listener, like stay psychically abreast of their mentation, through perhaps the rhythm of his - the listener’s - deliberate and default words, his like countenance, his bodily movements and stases, etc., all of which I congenitally do, except that it additionally occurs to me that the listener could also be engaged in surveying <i>my</i> mentation. Then, it is a matter of psychic tennis you see, one of us has to commit a fault for it to end. Or if you prefer, one of us has to truncate this like infinite series expansion.

B: Call it narcissism or solipsism or even alcoholism. I don’t give a deflagrating fuck.
