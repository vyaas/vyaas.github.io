&ldquo;I cannot love you like I love myself. I can only love you the way I wish to be loved.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Are you saying your love for yourself is different from the way you wish to love yourself?&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’m saying how I love myself is fundamentally different from how I wish to be loved.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Why can’t they be one and the same?&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Your question’s logical limit is the ridiculous proposition: <i>Why can’t two persons be the same?</i> They cannot. Even if they are the absolute spitting reflections of each other, in mind and body, cosmically cloned twins, they are two persons occupying two different spatial locations. Demarcated, thus identifiable. There is a boundary between each one’s self and the other. They can be two and the same, but they cannot be <i>one and the same</i>.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;So can your love for yourself and the love you wish you were given be <i>two and the same</i>?&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;No they can’t. Examine your words. One is an ability, the other a wish. One is my love for myself. The other is a wish for a kind of love that I cannot attain by virtue of being <i>inside</i> myself. I cannot <i>see</i> all of myself from <i>inside</i>. Only parts of it. And that is the extent of my self-love. In verse:<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>In my temple I kneel and pray, enclosed, alone</i><br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>Standing Outside, you behold a glorious monument of stone</i><br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>And even if through these heaven-supporting pillars you peer</i> <br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>Deaf to the prayer, only the praying is clear</i> <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
The unknown part of myself, that part which I cannot access by virtue of being <i>inside</i> myself, becomes impossible to love. It would be a love of vacuum, a vacuum of love, i.e. no love. It can only be done from <i>outside</i>.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;So the love you wish is really a wish to be <i>seen</i> a certain way?&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;If you look at it that way, this love is no different from loving myself. I would be using my lover as a mere agency for my own self-loving. This is what it means to love being <i>seen</i> a certain way. The love <i>I</i> wish however is that which comes <i>despite</i> being seen a certain way.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;So you wish to be loved unconditionally then.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;No. I wish to be loved very conditionally. I wish to be loved for who I am and not loved for loving’s sake. The love I wish is that which permits me to be myself. &rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;But if you wish to be loved for who you are, how can you be sure that who you are merits love?&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Indeed. I don’t. I never said I <i>deserved</i> love. I’m only expressing a desire for it.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Doesn’t this get complicated by the reality of human nature? Don’t you need to love your lover in return? In fact, it is the value of your returned love that produces your lover’s love for you.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;The reason I love my lover is not because he loves me, but because he is the realization of my ideals. My bent-into-the-shape-of-reality ideals. Imperfect, both him and my love for him. Do I love him because he loves me? That might be the cause, but not the reason.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You’re deep.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You’re sheep.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You’re funny.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You most certainly are not.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You like to have the last word.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I like my words to last.&rdquo; <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You like word play.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I like word sex.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;And weird sex.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Can we go on and on making love?&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Yes we can.&rdquo;<br/>
<br/>
