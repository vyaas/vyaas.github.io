\newline

As the air of your slumber is set ablaze 
\newline

By the shafts of morning window light 
\newline

And the birds are atweet with gossip and song
\newline

And the bell that turns a moment into a church 
\newline
\newline

Rings, Awakening your soul just before 
\newline

The kettles whistle and cookers roar 
\newline

And the smell of coffee makes you want more
\newline

And the news is bleak and a limitless bore 
\newline
\newline

You will get carried away by the escalating
\newline

Sound and Fury of the new unfolding day 
\newline

Soul and Body slowly peeled away 
\newline

A torture that is too intense to feel 
\newline

Too routine to reconsider the deal 
\newline \newline

Can you stop and dwell on the bell
\newline

That rang just before your kitchen went to hell?
\newline
\newline

We forget how easy it is to lose our minds \newline

Which is why we forget, yes? \newline
\newline
