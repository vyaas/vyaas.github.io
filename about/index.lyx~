Preoccupation: Pondering lifestyle choices in light of the amazing descriptions
 of Nature proffered by Boltzmann[^1], Einstein[^2], and Feynman[^3], the
 detailed and prophetic exposition of Capital by Karl Marx[^4], the soulful
 renditions of Jazz by Bill Evans[^5], the method of electro-shock-therapy-throu
gh-comedy pioneered by George Carlin[^6], the disturbing-of-comfortable-and-comf
orting-of-disturbed agenda of humanistic literature exemplified by David
 Foster Wallace[^7], the Kantian directions inscribed by Richard Stallman
 on our collective moral compass[^8], and the enigmatic effectiveness and
 spellbinding metaphysical sanctuary provided by Mathematics[^9].

**Most troubling observation:** >**"***In a time so rich in reflection and
 so devoted to raisonnement as our own, he must be a poor creature who cannot
 advance a good ground for everything, even for what is worst and most depraved.
 Everything in the world that has become corrupt, has had good ground for
 its corruption.***"** (Hegel, *Logic*, para.
 121)

**Psychological ailment:** Currently succumbing to *Bullshit Induced Aphasia*,
 an apparently incurable disease wherein the subject suffers the violent
 disemboweling of his senses upon hearing the sophistry of fatalists and
 teleologists through one ear and the drone of solipsists and nihilists
 through the other, resulting in a mental state of spaz-unto-death.
 What the subject looks like on the outside can only be left to one's imaginatio
n.

**Rationale for site's name:** Deconstructing and abstracting (while agonizingly
 susceptible to tautologies) is pretty much 90% of how my mind invites the
 world around me _indoors_.
 It has become, rather unwittingly, a comfortable escape, like a kind of
 living room of the mind with its own fireplace, persian rugs, and coffee
 pot, where ideas enter, converse, wrestle, and often leave without cleaning
 up after themselves, all with the showmanship of the finest thespians.
 If separated from this mental resort/theater, poorly curated as it might
 be, due to social commitments or general ennui, I begin to crave it again.
 Hence, _Analytic Cravings_.
 Please note that I loathe the word _Analytic_ as it appears in the phrase
 _Web Analytics_ which refers to data collection commissioned for the purpose
 of monetizing and advertizing (two activities which no matter how charitable
 I am towards, end up leaving me feeling disgusted).

This is Noether's theorem, arguably the sexiest in all of Physics! In English
 words, it says this: When you can write an extremum principle, like the
 principle of least action, for some phenomenon in Nature, and if you can
 locate a symmetry, like the homogeniety of space or of time, you will arrive
 at a conservation law, like the one for momentum or for energy.
 When confronted by the thought of death, I take solace in the fact that
 I have *at least* beheld this theorem! To catch such a panoramic glimpse
 of Natural Order while remaining emotionally subdued is a goddamn challenge
 of the highest order!

[^1]: The relationship of the note to the song, the citizen to the society,
 the cog to the machine, the axiom to the theorem, the word to the poem,
 and all such constitutions, evokes a sort of universal wonderment.
 In Physics, this tension between the part and the whole is best exemplified
 in the study of Thermodynamics.
 In it throbs a tension; that between the descriptions of part and whole,
 each of which is empirically verifiable in isolation via micro and macroscopic
 theories (often to incredible success), but their connection, which is
 necessarily grounded in probability calculus, has given rise to a gallery
 of interpretations, each with its philosophical basis and niggling discontents.
 Boltzmann pioneered this line of inquiry.
 Today, thanks to him, we are in a position to articulate the question of
 [life itself being derivable from underlying principles of Physics](https://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=e91D5UAz-f4).
 See [Boltzmann's Work in Statistical Physics.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/s

\begin_layout Standard
[^2]: I remember being utterly captivated by Einstein's revolutionary yet
 innocent-seeming line of reasoning upon reading the following lines for
 the first time: *"If we wish to describe the motion of a material point,
 we give the values of its coordinates as functions of the time.
 Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this
 kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand
 by â€œtime.â€ We have to take into account that all our judgments in which
 time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events.
 If, for instance, I say, â€œThat train arrives here at 7 oâ€™clock,â€ I
 mean something like this: â€œThe pointing of the small hand of my watch
 to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.â€ It might appear
 possible to overcome all the difficulties attending the definition of â€œtimeâ€
 by substituting â€œthe position of the small hand of my watchâ€ for â€œtime.â€
 And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with
 defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located; but
 it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of
 events occurring at different places, or â€” what comes to the same thing
 â€” to evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the
 watch."* You can almost feel his presence in the living room of your mind,
 gently prodding on the chinaware atop the mantel, preparing to shatter
 all sorts of things! Note the clarity in language, an obvious reflection
 of clarity in thought.
 All understanding can happen only after the diligent disentangling of neighbori
ng ideas.
 And let no idea be considered too sacred for this! See [Einstein, A., On
 The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies, 1905.](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einste

[^3]: If Einstein destroyed the furniture of my mind's living room, Feynman
 ripped away its curtains! Every one of [his inimitable lectures on Physics](htt
p://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) has revealed to me yet another dimension
 of Beauty in our Universe.
 When reading him, I feel a calm enlightening.
 It's the sincerity in his voice; he always asked deceptively simple questions
 and challenged us to do the same! And just as Boltzmann's fascination with
 a problem was infectious, so too was Feynman's.
 His work in uniting Hamilton's and Jacobi's optical interpretation of Mechanics
, and Schroedinger's and deBroglie's ideas on so called Wave mechanics,
 by showing both as a consequence of that enigmatic Principle of Least Action,
 is one of the most exciting intellectual adventures in the history of Science.
 His [Messenger Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF96D8FFDDE4B9087
) are a constant source of inspiration for me and countless others.

[^4]: Capitalism has managed to hermetically seal itself from critical reform.
 We live in a world where the following questions recieve more admonition
 than attention: *1) Capitalism thrives on greed.
 Then are the culturally codified cliches on the greed-evil affiliation
 legit? 2) Why do we go out of our way to protect the interests of businessmen
 by granting them intellectual property, political power, financial clemency,
 and social status as role-models while poor laborers (farmers, miners,
 fishermen, cab drivers, mechanics, carpenters, etc.) are villified for complaini
ng, protesting, and unionizing? Has our sense of proportion taken leave
 of us? 3) If Capitalism guarantees so called booms and busts, it also guarantee
s a never diminishing reserve army of unemployed people.
 This endows capitalists with the obscene power of deciding the minimum
 wage and ultimately the poverty line.
 Also, workers are disenfranchised; they can't own the fruits of their labor,
 the means of production, the intellectual permissions to affect change,
 etc..
 Is Capitalism simply neo-imperialism?* The general reluctance of people
 to engage seriously with these questions makes me wonder if they are prescribin
g that bitter ignorance-is-bliss pill or simply reacting in any way fitting
 of someone who benefits from the tenets of Capitalism.
 In either case, the principles of equality and justice aren't permissive
 to fickle rationalizations.
 Our pursuit for Truth requires that we abandon to a large degree our longing
 to "imagine" a different fairer world.
 Rather, by seeing the world for what it is, i.e.
 letting our thoughts reflect our material surroundings and not the other
 way around, we will allow ourselves the objectivity to grapple with our
 current system of economy.
 It is this *materialism*, injected of course with *dialectic* i.e.
 the spotting of contradiction, its informed resolution, its resulting contradic
tion, and so on and so on, that is the mode of inquiry in Marx's multi-volume
 Capital (The first volume can be read [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mar
x/works/1867-c1/)).
 Marx reveals to us Capitalism's metabolism, its defense mechanisms, its
 religious institutionalization, and its apologist's weakest points.
 Maybe Communism will prove to be a tough sell (although it has never been
 realized the way Marx had outlined, not even closely), Marx's critique
 of Capitalism remains invaluable.
 I must direct a good deal of gratitude towards [David Harvey](http://www.versobo
oks.com/books/376-a-companion-to-marx-s-capital) for making Marx accessible
 to my generation.
 (Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0A7FFF28B99C1303)
 to his video lectures.)

[^5]: If Music is the language of the soul, Bill Evans embodied a beautiful

 In my most emotionally tired moments, when the stretch marks of existence

 of Bill Evans.

 made me go, "Wait! You can say that? You can *think* that?".

[^7]: " *Maybe it's the fact the most of the arts here are produced by world-wea
ry and sophisticated older people and then consumed by younger people who
 not only consume art but study it for clues on how to be cool, hip - and
 keep in mind that, for kids and younger people, to be hip and cool is the
 same as to be admired and accepted and included and so Unalone.
 Forget so-called peer-pressure.
 It's more like peer-hunger.
 No? We enter a spiritual puberty where we snap to the fact that the great
 transcendant horror is loneliness, excluded encagement in the self.
 Once we've hit this age, we will now give or take anything, wear any mask,
 to fit, be part-of, not be Alone, we young.
 The U.S.
 arts are our guide to inclusion.
 A how-to.
 We are shown how to fashion masks of ennui and jaded irony at a young age
 where the face is fictile enough to assume the shape of whatever it wears.
 And then it's stuck there, the weary cynicism that saves us from gooey
 sentiment and unsophisticated naivete.* " - David Foster Wallace, [Infinite
 Jest ](http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/david-foster-wallace/infinite-jest

\begin_layout Standard
[^8]: Most of us use computers everyday.
 We use it for communicating, shopping, banking, learning, etc.
 This is possible due to software, specifically, programs.
 It is not at all batshit to assume that users should control programs and
 not the other way around.
 The syllogism goes: "if programs are written by people, and these programs
 control the user, then effectively people control users." That a computer
 can automatically download software through a backdoor without a user's
 permission, that a user cannot modify or even inspect what a program is
 *really* executing, that certain hardware refuses to work unless it is
 fed so called *proprietary* software, that a user's data is collected and
 surveyed without consent, that a software patent can secure for its owner
 the power to take away people's rights to discover and implement solutions
 to computational problems themselves (this more than anything else hurts
 me the most) are all examples of gross encroachments on our liberty.
 It is also highly undemocratic and antisocial as it disenfranchises the
 many and empowers the few.
 Free Software, Richard Stallman submits, is ethical as it empowers *all*
 users and promotes a culture of sharing.
 To say that such a world cannot exist is naked denial.
 The movement to develop, distribute, and curate free software (free as
 in *Freedom* and not free as in *free beer*), has gained critical mass!
 Stallman has inspired me, and many others, to take the challenging but
 exciting road of writing and using free software! See [The Essays of Richard
 Stallman (PDF)](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fsfs/rms-essays.pdf)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[^9]: Mathematics has been our best effort in formulating a language of
 reasoning.
 That its *words* are used to describe the Natural World so effectively
 remains a poetic mystery.
 One can get carried away in this sanctuary of symbols, often forgetting
 what these symbols stand for.
 This is a trap Physicists are only too wary of.
 But quite often, we end up with mathematical statements of truth before
 understanding the meaning behind the symbols (famous examples are Maxwell's
 Equations, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the Second law of Thermodynamics
).
 This is unlike any other language! Mathematics is indeed a metaphysically
 singular subject! See [Wigner, E., The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics
, 1960.](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html)
