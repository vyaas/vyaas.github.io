Where shall we meet?
\newline

At the crossroads of our faiths?
\newline

The garden of our slow dance? 
\newline

The quiet pond of our innocence? 
\newline

The tree tops of our dreams? 
\newline

The soft beach of our music? 
\newline

The Church of our making?
\newline

I would love to see you,
\newline

And for Love to see us.
