\title{Honey I'm home}

\begin{document} \newline

He spends and fends for means and ends.

She cooks and books and cleans all nooks.

He drives, she knives, he groans, she moans.

He wonders, she dreams, they're married it seems.

\newline

The children come, she goes numb.

The children wail, he glugs ale.

The children smoke, he goes broke.

The children leave, she can't believe.

\newline
\newline

He-she have nothing, nothing anymore.

Except each other, and maybe a whore.

She finds out, and goes insane.

He sucks a gun, and kills the pain.
