  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Vyaas Gururajan</p>

<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Perishing PhD Student.</p>

<p><strong>Preoccupation:</strong> Pondering lifestyle choices in light of the amazing descriptions of Nature proffered by Boltzmann<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Einstein<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and Feynman[^3], the detailed and prophetic exposition of Capital by Karl Marx[^4], the soulful renditions of Jazz by Bill Evans[^5], the method of electro-shock-therapy-through-comedy pioneered by George Carlin[^6], the disturbing-of-comfortable-and-comforting-of-disturbed agenda of humanistic literature exemplified by David Foster Wallace[^7], the Kantian directions inscribed by Richard Stallman on our collective moral compass[^8], and the enigmatic effectiveness and spellbinding metaphysical sanctuary provided by Mathematics[^9].</p>

<p><strong>Most troubling observation:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;</strong><em>In a time so rich in reflection and so devoted to raisonnement as our own, he must be a poor creature who cannot advance a good ground for everything, even for what is worst and most depraved. Everything in the world that has become corrupt, has had good ground for its corruption.</em><strong>&quot;</strong> (Hegel, <em>Logic</em>, para. 121)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Psychological ailment:</strong> Currently succumbing to <em>Bullshit Induced Aphasia</em>, an apparently incurable disease wherein the subject suffers the violent disemboweling of his senses upon hearing the sophistry of fatalists and teleologists through one ear and the high pitched drone of solipsists and nihilists through the other, resulting in a mental state of spaz-unto-death. What the subject looks like on the outside can only be left to one&#39;s imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Theorem:</strong></p>

<p>If the functional</p>

<p>$$ J  = \int_a^b L(t,q^\mu,\dot{q^\mu})dt $$</p>

<p>is an extremal, and if under the infinitesimal transformation</p>

<p>$$ t&#39; = r +\epsilon\tau + ..., $$
$$ q^{\mu&#39;}  = q^{\mu} + \epsilon\zeta^\mu + ... $$</p>

<p>the functional is invariant according to the definition (following the inhomogeneous case)
$$ L&#39; \frac{dt&#39;}{dt} - L = \epsilon\frac{dF}{dt} + O(\epsilon^s),$$ where \( s\gt 1 \), 
then the following conservation law holds:
$$ \displaystyle p_{\mu}\zeta{^\mu} - H\tau - F = const. $$</p>

<p>This is Noether&#39;s theorem, arguably the sexiest in all of Physics! In English words, it says this:
When you can write an extremum principle, like the principle of least action, for some phenomenon in Nature, and if you can locate a symmetry, like the homogeniety of space or of time, you will arrive at a conservation law, like the one for momentum or for energy. When confronted by the thought of death, I take solace in the fact that I have <em>at least</em> beheld this theorem! To catch such a panoramic glimpse of Natural Order while remaining emotionally subdued is a goddamn challenge of the highest order!</p>

<p>The relationship of the note to the song, the citizen to the society, the cog to the machine, the axiom to the theorem, the word to the poem, and all such constitutions evokes a sort of universal wonderment. In Physics, this tension between the part and the whole is exemplified no better than the study of thermodynamics. In it throbs a tension; that between the descriptions of part and whole, each of which are empirically verifiable in isolation via micro and macroscopic theories (often to incredible success), but their connection, which is necessarily grounded in probability calculus, has given rise to a gallery of interpretations, each with its philosophical basis and niggling discontents. Boltzmann pioneered this line of inquiry. Today, thanks to him, we are in a position to articulate the question of life itself being derivable from underlying principles of Physics.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Einstein&#39;s invitation to reconsider what we mean when we utter concepts related to time transcends its subject matter; it will remain timeless! When I first read the following lines, I knew I had <em>experienced</em> unadulterated genius: <em>&quot;Let us take a system of coordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good. In order to render our presentation more precise and to distinguish this system of co-ordinates verbally from others which will be introduced hereafter, we call it the “stationary system.” If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of co-ordinates, its position can be defined relatively thereto by the employment of rigid standards of measurement and the methods of Euclidean geometry, and can be expressed in Cartesian co-ordinates. If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of its coordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time.” We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say, “That train arrives here at 7 o’clock,” I mean something like this: “The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.” It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending the definition of “time” by substituting “the position of the small hand of my watch” for “time.” And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring at different places, or — what comes to the same thing — to evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the watch.&quot;</em> You can almost feel his presence in the living room of your mind, gently prodding on the ceramic vase above the fireplace, preparing to shatter all sorts of things! Note the clarity in language, an obvious reflection of clarity in thought. All understanding can happen only after the diligent disentangling of neighboring ideas. And let no idea be considered too sacred for this!
