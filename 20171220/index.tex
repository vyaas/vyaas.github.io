\newline

Does the soul leave its host
\newline

On the last breath out the nose? 
\newline

Does it shimmy out the skin 
\newline

Dead clothing it's weighed within? 
\newline

Does it leap off the tongue 
\newline

Swan dive like a hero unsung?
\newline

Or does it steam out the ears?
\newline

Or squeak clear out the rear?
\newline
