Ropes of bodily white hang from pulsing nostrils burned from kerchief
chafe. Beard soggy with sweat, tears, and flu-juice. Dilated eyes soak
up double the dreadful light. Vomit prone head cantilevers off a back
bent with pain. Dry throat torn like bad draft. Groin smells like
tropical coitus. Sphincter coughs a threat. Novel doesn't write itself.
Ceiling fan plays the death march. Ideas flee to assemble a nightmare.
Where a writer's ink catches fire and destroys all that he has written.
He wakes up and wipes the bile off his face.
