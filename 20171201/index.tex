The Universe will preserve our cataclysm

In the infinite memory of her Light

The green flames of our Greed

The Birds reduced from chirp to char

The You \& Me Love that was too shallow to spread

The Art that never paralyzed the powerful

The elegies to our Hope

Trampled by the spiked heels of the Second Law
