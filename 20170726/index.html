I once tripped and fell in a ditch. The ditch was shaped like me and would only go as deep as I could. I made the ditch my home and was too afraid to leave; what if I fell into another ditch that wasn’t my size? <br/>
<br/>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
In this ditch I passed time by wondering how I really knew that the ditch-sized-me <i>belonged</i> in a ditch my size. I called my inquiries <i>Philosophy</i> and assured myself that I was <i>transcending</i> my ditch by questioning its place in <i>my</i> life. I realized that this ditch would never change and by extension <i>I</i> would never change. All I knew was the ditch, and the only depth this ditch had was what I knew from my fall into it. <br/>
<br/>

I tried digging the ditch for more depth, but the floor was too hard. When I put more effort into digging, my fingers bled. Sometimes I wouldn’t care and keep digging, but other times I stopped because I was scared I’d dig myself into irreversible darkness. I was too afraid to climb out and I was too afraid to dig deep. Fear stabilized me in the ditch. I was proud of my Philosophy. <br/>
<br/>

<div class="Indented">
As my Life neared its end, I fondly touched the walls of my ditch with my weak hands. Just as all my Life was spent in this ditch, all my Death would be spent in it too; I would have conquered eternity itself! I died with my mouth and eyes open. My elbows were quivering, my knees felt tingly, my inhales and exhales grew lengthier. I can’t remember when my breathing stopped, but I remember the ditch getting smaller and smaller, almost like it was still trying to fit me. <br/>
