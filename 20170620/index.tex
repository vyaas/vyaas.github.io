\title{Joe the Shit}

\begin{document} \newline

Joe paces like a predator,

Thoughts fear his savage analysis,

His Mind torments its confined body,

\newline 

Joe singes all affection,

No Devotion ever good enough,

Except his self-endorsing ego's.

\newline

Joe wins by playing with no one.

Joe dances only when the person watching is as piss drunk as he is.

Joe never calls home because it bores him.

\newline

Joe demands Morality by driving away Love.

Joe demands Clarity by scaring away Doubt.

Joe demands Reality by scandalizing Hope.

\newline

One day Joe will die,

And in those last minutes,

He will certainly not ask himself,

``Have I been a total shit?''
