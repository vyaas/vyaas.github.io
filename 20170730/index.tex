\title{Pacific blows}

\begin{document} \newline

Sand was sucked from around my heels\newline\newline

As the undercurrent always did its meals.\newline\newline

I plead with Time's indifferent spoon\newline\newline

As it served me up to Nature's tune.\newline\newline
\newline\newline

The wave grew before my salt-burned eyes\newline\newline

Into a cusp set for violent demise.\newline\newline

I was slapped like a child that never grows\newline\newline

And humbled by these Pacific blows.\newline\newline


\end{document}
