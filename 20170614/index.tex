\title{Cantor's toes}

\begin{document} \newline

``Is Nature continuous or merely discrete?''

Asked the man staring at his toes

Wondering if the space around his feet

Was filled with material zeroes.

\newline \newline

``My toes are ten, but what's in between?

A space of points I cannot count!

If all the toes of the Universe were keen

Could they not sum up the amount?``

\newline \newline

``If every toe married every speck ,

In a most monogamous way lets insist,

Their magnitudes of size would be in check,

However infinitely they might exist!``


\end{document}
