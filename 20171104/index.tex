The Dreams of Mothers are smuggled 
\newline

In with genes.
\newline

Mothers, daughters of Mothers.
\newline

Did they drop Art to Create Us?
\newline

Or was it Art all along?
\newline

And if Creation equals Liberation,
\newline

For whom, the Creator 
\newline

Or the creat-ure?
\newline

Oh Mother, why are you silent,
\newline

Like a tree, 
\newline

On the question of Freedom?
