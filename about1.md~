**Occupation:** Perishing PhD Student

**Preoccupation:** Pondering lifestyle choices in light of the amazing descriptions of Nature proffered by Boltzmann, Einstein, and Feynman, the detailed and prophetic exposition of Capital by Karl Marx, the soulful renditions of Jazz by Bill Evans, the method of electro-shock-therapy-through-comedy pioneered by George Carlin, the disturbing-of-comfortable-and-comforting-of-disturbed agenda of humanistic literature exemplified by David Foster Wallace, the Kantian directions inscribed by Richard Stallman on our collective moral compass, and the enigmatic effectiveness and spellbinding metaphysical sanctuary provided by Mathematics.

**Psychological ailment:** Currently battling *Bullshit Induced Aphasia*, an apparently incurable disease wherein the subject suffers the violent disemboweling of his senses upon hearing the sophistry of fatalists and teleologists through one ear and the high pitched drone of solipsists and nihilists through the other, resulting in a mental state of spaz-unto-death. What the subject looks like on the outside can only be left to one's imagination.

$$ J  = \int\limits_a^b L(t,q^\mu,\dot{q^\mu})dt $$
$$ t' = r +\epsilon\tau + ..., $$
$$ q^{\mu'}  = q^{\mu} + \epsilon\zeta^\mu + ... $$
$$ L' \frac{dt'}{dt} - L = \epsilon\frac{dF}{dt} + O(\epsilon^s),$$ where \\( s\gt 1 \\),
