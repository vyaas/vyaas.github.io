**Name:** Vyaas Gururajan

**Occupation:** Perishing PhD Student

**Preoccupation:** Pondering lifestyle choices in light of the amazing descriptions of Nature proffered by Boltzmann, Einstein, and Feynman, the detailed and prophetic exposition of Capital by Karl Marx, the soulful renditions of Jazz by Bill Evans, the method of electro-shock-therapy-through-comedy pioneered by George Carlin, the disturbing-of-comfortable-and-comforting-of-disturbed agenda of humanistic literature exemplified by David Foster Wallace, the Kantian directions inscribed by Richard Stallman on our collective moral compass, and the enigmatic effectiveness and spellbinding metaphysical sanctuary provided by Mathematics.

**Most troubling observation:**
>**"***In a time so rich in reflection and so devoted to raisonnement as our own, he must be a poor creature who cannot advance a good ground for everything, even for what is worst and most depraved. Everything in the world that has become corrupt, has had good ground for its corruption.***"** (Hegel, *Logic*, para. 121)

**Psychological ailment:** Currently succumbing to *Bullshit Induced Aphasia*, an apparently incurable disease wherein the subject suffers the violent disemboweling of his senses upon hearing the sophistry of fatalists and teleologists through one ear and the high pitched drone of solipsists and nihilists through the other, resulting in a mental state of spaz-unto-death. What the subject looks like on the outside can only be left to one's imagination.

**Favorite Theorem:**

If the functional

$$ J  = \int_a^b L(t,q^\mu,\dot{q^\mu})dt $$

is an extremal, and if under the infinitesimal transformation

$$ t' = r +\epsilon\tau + ..., $$
$$ q^{\mu'}  = q^{\mu} + \epsilon\zeta^\mu + ... $$

the functional is invariant according to the definition (following the inhomogeneous case)
$$ L' \frac{dt'}{dt} - L = \epsilon\frac{dF}{dt} + O(\epsilon^s),$$ where \\( s\gt 1 \\), 
then the following conservation law holds:
$$ \displaystyle p\_{\mu}\zeta{^\mu} - H\tau - F = const. $$


This is Noether's theorem, arguably the sexiest in all of Physics! In English words, it says this:
When you can write an extremum principle, like the principle of least action, for some phenomenon in Nature, and if you can locate a symmetry, like the homogeniety of space or of time, you will arrive at a conservation law, like the one for momentum or for energy. This description of Nature is straight out batshit crazy! Its unbelievable! But it fits everything we've ever observed! It not only has survived the test of experiment, but has suggested experiments to stress-test itself and led to stunning discoveries in Physics! When confronted by the thought of death, I take solace in the fact that I have *at least* beheld this theorem! To catch such a panoramic glimpse of Natural Order and remain emotionally subdued is a goddamn challenge of the highest order!
