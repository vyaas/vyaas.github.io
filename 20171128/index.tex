\newline

How tiring it is
\newline

To learn to learn,
\newline

To fear fear,
\newline

To look forward to looking forward.
\newline

Stretched and as rare as the thinning air.
\newline

This murmuring wind, the sound
\newline

Of my Heart, calling from a distance,
\newline

Stretched and Out There.
\newline

To Love to Love,
\newline

So much to Love,
\newline

All impeded by these damn words.
\newline
